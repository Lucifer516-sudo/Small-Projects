# Little-Projects
A collection of basic programs as I progress and learn programming 

Will mostly be Python related projects - Pygame, Tkinter, RPi related stuff

These codes are a mixture of different things,

I have been looking at GUI development, and pygame. A few of the programs are calculator related, some I use
for real life applications. 

Every calculator has been cross checked with various online calculators - and 
results were always accurate when testing.

I had problems with the 'Exit' buttons on a few of the Tkinter apps - freezing up, program not responding etc
I left the lines of code, but commented them out.

If you use these little apps I welcome any feedback and improvements
