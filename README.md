# Little-Projects
===================================================================================================================

Requirements to run these little apps: Python 2.7 unless specified otherwise

====================================================================================================================

A collection of basic programs as I progress and learn programming 

Will mostly be Python related projects - Pygame, Tkinter, RPi related stuff

These codes are a mixture of different things,

I have been looking at GUI development, and pygame. A few of the calculator related programs have been moved to a Calculator repository, 

I had problems with the 'Exit' buttons on a few of the Tkinter apps - freezing up, program not responding etc
I left the lines of code, but commented them out. I believe it is only my Windows machine causing this as
I dont get it on Ubuntu or Raspbian

If you use these little apps I welcome any feedback and improvements
